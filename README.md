# Responsive Homepage

The goal of this project was responsive and flexible design. I used flexbox, grid, and float(only for text wrapping) to position the elements and practiced, using srcset to reduce image load times. I used a mobile-first design approach then moved on to tablet and browser viewports. 

If I were to do this again I would start with a simple HTML/CSS repository instead of setting up Webpack, but all the mistakes came with learning opportunities! Onto the React curriculum next!
